		<h2>Class Features</h2>
		<h3>Barbarian Rage</h3>
		<p>Once per day, use a quick action to start raging. A rage lasts until the end of battle, or about 5 minutes.<br>
		   While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown weapon attacks instead of 1d20. Use the higher roll for the attack. If you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a hit, the attack is a critical hit!<br>
		   Recharge 16+: After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add your Constitution modifier. On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again later in the day.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> Whenever the escalation die is 4+, as a quick action, you can start raging for free. (It doesn’t count against your normal usage.) This rage lasts until the end of the battle, as normal.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> You can now start raging freely when the escalation die is 3+.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> You can now start raging freely when the escalation die is 2+.</p>
		   
		<br><hr>
		
		<h2>Adventurer Talents</h2>
		<h3>Barbaric Cleave</h3>
		<p>Once per battle, as a free action, make a Barbarian melee attack after you drop a non-mook enemy to 0 hp with a Barbarian melee attack. Mooks do not count for this, unless the mook you dropped was the last of its mook mob.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> You gain a +2 attack bonus with Barbaric Cleave attacks. If the cleave attack hits, you can heal using a recovery.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> If there is no foe engaged with you to use your Barbaric Cleave attack against, as a free action you can move to a nearby foe before making the attack.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> While raging, you can use Barbaric Cleave as many times as you like during a battle, but only once per round.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Building Frenzy</h3>
		<p>One battle per day, as a free action after you have missed an attack, gain +1d4 damage to each successful melee attack until the end of the battle. For each missed attack following this, add another +1d4 damage, up to a maximum of +4d4 damage.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> Bonus damage dice are now d6s.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> Bonus damage dice are now d10s.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> You can use Building Frenzy twice a day.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Slayer</h3>
		<p>During your turn, when you attack a staggered enemy you were not engaged with at the start of your turn, deal +1d6 damage per level to that creature if you hit.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> You gain a +2 bonus to Slayer attacks.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> Once per battle, when you miss with a Slayer attack, deal the additional +1d6-per-level damage to the target instead of normal miss damage.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> Whenever one of your Slayer attacks drops a non-mook enemy to 0 hp, you gain 20 temporary hit points.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Strongheart</h3>
		<p>Your recovery dice are d12s instead of d10s.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> Increase your total number of recoveries by 1.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> You gain +1 PD. When you heal using a recovery, you can roll a save against a save ends effect.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> Increase your total number of recoveries by 1 (making a total of +2 from this talent).</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Unstoppable</h3>
		<p>Once per battle, declare you’re using Unstoppable before making a barbarian melee attack. If your attack hits at least one target, you can heal using a recovery.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> The Unstoppable recovery is free.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> Add double your Constitution modifier to the healing the recovery provides.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> You can use Unstoppable twice per battle.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Whirlwind</h3>
		<p>You can make a Whirlwind attack as the first action of your turn when you are engaged by two or more enemies.<br>
		   You take a –4 penalty to your AC and PD until the start of your next turn. Then roll a separate melee attack against each enemy you are engaged with. You deal no miss damage with these attacks.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> You now deal normal miss damage with missed Whirlwind attacks.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> The penalty to your AC and PD is reduced to –2. In addition, disengage checks you make the same turn as using Whirlwind automatically succeed.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> You can use Whirlwind anytime during your turn, not just as the first action.</p>
		
		<br><hr>
		
		<h2>Champion Talents</h2>
		<h3>Natural Will</h3>
		<p>One battle per day as a quick action, you gain a +2 bonus to your Mental Defense until the end of the battle.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> You can now use Natural Will in two battles per day.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> The bonus increases to +4 Mental Defense.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> You can now use Natural Will as a free action when an enemy attacks you.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Roaring Rage</h3>
		<p><b>Special:</b> You must be a Dragonspawn.<br>
		      When you use your breath weapon while you are not raging, roll a save. If you succeed, you start raging and continue raging until the end of your next turn. This power functions like other barbarian 
			  rages, but it neither expends a rage nor gives you the option to roll to recharge your rage after the battle.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> Until you’ve succeeded once in a day with the roaring rage save, it’s an easy save (6+) instead of a normal save.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> If you score a critical hit with your breath weapon, you can start raging as a free rage that lasts until the end of the battle and does not expend your use of Barbarian Rage.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Violence</h3>
		<p>Once per battle, add a +1d4 bonus to a barbarian melee attack roll after finding out whether you hit or missed.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> If the attack still misses, deal half damage.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> The bonus increases to +1d6.</p>
		
		<br><hr>
		
		<h2>Epic Talents</h2>
		<h3>Ancestral Warband</h3>
		<p>One battle per day as a quick action, you can call the spirits of your ancestors to fight alongside you. Your ancestors can’t be hurt or affected by the creatures of this world.<br>
		   At the end of each of your turns, if you are conscious, roll a d6. If you roll less than or equal to the escalation die, a member of your spirit warband strikes from the spirit realm into the world. 
		   Make a melee attack against a nearby enemy as if you were making the attack yourself, using any talents, feats, or magic items as you see fit. This attack doesn’t take any of your actions.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> Your Ancestral Warband spirits are always raging, even if you are not, and continue to fight for a single round while you are unconscious.</p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h3>Relentless</h3>
		<p>While raging, you have resist damage 12+ (when an attack targets you, the attacker must roll a natural 12 or higher on the attack roll or it only deals half damage).<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> Even when not raging, whenever you score a critical hit against an enemy, you have resist damage 12+ until the start of your next turn.</p>
		
		<br><hr>
		
		<h2>Barbarian Multiclass</h2>
		<h3>Controlled Rage</h3>
		<p><b><i>Adventurer Tier</i></b> You can use powers and attacks from your other class while raging. You can’t use the extra d20 that Barbarian Rage gives you while making an attack from the other class, 
		         but at least you can slip out of your rage long enough to use a power or attack from your other class.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Tier</i></b> Once per battle while raging, you can use a melee attack from your other class as if it was a barbarian attack, rolling 2d20 for the attack. (Examples of possible uses include a bard’s 
		      flexible attack battle cries, a commander attack using the Lead from the Front talent that will garner command points, a fighter’s flexible attacks, a ranger’s double melee attack, and so on.)</p>
