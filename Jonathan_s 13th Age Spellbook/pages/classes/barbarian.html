		<h2>Class Features</h2>
		<h3>Barbarian Rage</h3>
		<p>Once per day, use a quick action to start raging. A rage lasts until the end of battle, or about 5 minutes.<br>
		   While raging, you roll 2d20 to hit with your barbarian melee and thrown weapon attacks instead of 1d20. Use the higher roll for the attack. If you roll a natural 11+ with both dice and your highest attack roll is a hit, the attack is a critical hit!<br>
		   Recharge 16+: After a battle in which you rage, roll a d20 and add your Constitution modifier. On a 16+, you can use Barbarian Rage again later in the day.</p>

		<h2>Adventurer Talents</h2>
		<h3>Barbaric Cleave</h3>
		<p>Once per battle, as a free action, make a Barbarian melee attack after you drop a non-mook enemy to 0 hp with a Barbarian melee attack. Mooks do not count for this, unless the mook you dropped was the last of its mook mob.<br>
		<b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> You gain a +2 attack bonus with Barbaric Cleave attacks. If the cleave attack hits, you can heal using a recovery.<br>
		<b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> If there is no foe engaged with you to use your Barbaric Cleave attack against, as a free action you can move to a nearby foe before making the attack.<br>
		<b><i>Epic Feat</i></b> While raging, you can use Barbaric Cleave as many times as you like during a battle, but only once per round.<br>
