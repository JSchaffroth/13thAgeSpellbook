		<label class="label" for="chaosMage_chaosMagic"><span style="font-size:19px;"><b>Chaos Magic</b></span><br>
			Chaos magic has three main categories of spells: attack, defense, and iconic.<br>
			Since the category of magic spells you’ll cast is randomly chosen, you’ll need 6 “stones” (gems, beads, poker chips, or whatever you like) of three different colors—two stones for each color. You’ll also need a bag (or cup) to put them in and draw them from. Put two of each color into the bag, then assign one color to attack, one color to defense, and the last color to iconic.<br>
			If you’d rather use dice instead of stones in a bag, use a d6; 1-2 is attack, 3-4 is defense, 5-6 is iconic.<br>
			You draw a stone from the bag to determine the next type of spell you’ll be able to cast. You usually do this when you roll initiative at the start of a battle, at the end of your turn (to set up the spell you can cast during your next turn), or as required during your turn if you somehow get an extra standard action.<br>
			Each stone you draw should be set aside so that each turn you draw from a smaller pool of stones. When there is one stone left in the bag, don’t draw it. Instead, refill the bag with the other six stones and draw. At the end of the battle, refill the bag.<br>
			If you draw…
			<ul><li>Attack: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be an attack spell, but you won’t have to choose the spell until your turn.</li>
			<li>Defense: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be a defense spell, but you won’t have to choose the spell until your turn.</li>
			<li>Iconic: The next chaos mage spell you cast during the battle must be an iconic spell. Immediately roll a die to determine which icon’s spells you’ll have to choose from. For example, if there are 12 icons in your game, assign a number to each icon and roll a d12. You don’t have to choose the specific spell until your turn.</li></ul><br>
			Whether you cast an at-will, per-battle, or daily spell, you cast it at the spell level shown on the spell progression table.</label>
		<input id="chaosMage_chaosMagic_a" type="checkbox" data-label-id="label_chaos_02" class="checkbox">
		<label class="label" for="chaosMage_chaosMagic_a"><b><i>Adventurer Feat</i></b> Once per day when you cast an iconic daily or once-per-battle spell from an icon you have at least a one-point relationship with, roll a normal save. If you succeed, you don’t expend that spell, allowing you to cast it again, or another daily/once-per-battle spell.</label>
		<input id="chaosMage_chaosMagic_c" type="checkbox" data-label-id="label_chaos_03" class="checkbox">
		<label class="label" for="chaosMage_chaosMagic_c"><b><i>Champion Feat</i></b> Once per day when you draw an iconic spell, before rolling, choose an icon you have at least a one-point relationship with. The spell you cast next will be from that icon.</label>

		<label class="label" for="chaosMage_highWeirdness"><span style="font-size:19px;"><b>High Weirdness</b></span><br>
			Chaos mages usually display an uncanny weirdness that presents itself through their spellcasting, and sometimes even bleeds through to their general demeanor. This weirdness is represented in game mechanics through the High Weirdness table below.<br>
			When an enemy scores a critical hit against you, roll high weirdness and consult the table to see what effect applies. If you hate the effect you’re experiencing, you can use a standard action to change it. Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of the battle.<br>
			Unless otherwise specified, the high weirdness effects last until the end of the battle.<br>
			Spell level: Whether you’re casting an at-will, per battle, or daily spell, you cast it at the spell level shown on the level progression chart.<br>
			If you don’t cast a spell: If circumstances dictate that you need to do something else with your standard action during your turn than cast a chaos mage spell (like rally), keep the stone you chose until you do cast a chaos mage spell. You don’t get to re-choose.<br>

					<td><b>14</b></td>
					<td>Your (the PC) favorite song begins playing around you magically, getting louder and louder (tell the table what type of song it is, or maybe hum it). It might or might not interfere with bardic songs or monsters that need to be heard properly to get their dirty work done.</td>

					<td>There’s tension in the air, or the rumble of distant thunder, or a sense of impending disaster, and the next creature that misses with an attack this battle takes damage equal your Charisma modifier (double your Charisma modifier at 5th level; triple it at 8th level).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>25-26</b></td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>45-46</b></td>
					<td>Your shadow detaches and flits around you. Until the weirdness ends, you gain a +2 attack bonus but take a –2 penalty to saves. Your personality may or may not be affected. It’s up to you.</td>

					<td>You gain an additional quick action during each of your turns while this weirdness is in effect.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>61-65</b></td>
					<td>You and your allies gain small halos, or celestial light pours in, or a subtle glow illuminates each countenance. When one of your allies casts a divine spell this battle, it gains a small bonus effect chosen by the GM, something that suits the spell and the story.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>66-70</b></td>
					<td>Your features shift and settle into a temporary new pattern. You gain a random racial ability until the end of your next turn. Ignore results that duplicate a racial ability you already have. Roll a d8. 1: dwarf’s that’s your best shot; 2: dark elf’s cruel; 3: high elf’s highblood teleport; 4: gnome’s confounding; 5: half–elf’s surprising; 6: halfling’s evasive; 7: holy one’s halo; 8: tieflings’s curse of chaos.</td>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>81-85</b></td>
					<td>Your presence blurs through space, spirit, and time, and you can fight in spirit on your turn (see Combat Rules, Special Action) in addition to taking your normal turn.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>86-90</b></td>
					<td>You shift, you waver, or you go transparent. You don’t take any miss damage while this weirdness is affecting you.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>91-95</b></td>
					<td>The magic items in the area all start talking at once. You or one ally of your choice can roll to recharge one magic item (affected creature’s choice).</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>96-97</b></td>
					<td>Something related to your one unique thing goes very right for you. This is on you and the GM to work out together. The GM has the final say, though.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>98</b></td>
					<td>If you and your allies flee RIGHT NOW, you don’t take a campaign loss for your discretion. This may take some explaining. It’s all about the chaos magic.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>99</b></td>
					<td>Roll twice more on this table. If you wish you can ignore one of the rolled results but must stick with the other. If you roll the same result twice, you get that weirdness just once.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><b>100</b></td>
					<td>You gain an extra standard action during the next turn after this weirdness goes into effect.</td>

		<h2>Class Talents</h2>
		<h3>Warp Talents</h3>
		There are three separate Warp talents that you may choose from. They provide random powers or features that surface unpredictably during battles (and perhaps during non-combat moments of high tension).<br>
		If a warp talent gives you access to a spell from another class, associate it with chaos magic’s attack category or defense category. You can then cast it if that spell type comes up for you.<br>
		<input id="chaosMage_attackingWarp" type="checkbox" data-label-id="label_chaos_09" class="checkbox">
		<label class="label" for="chaosMage_attackingWarp"><span style="font-size:19px;"><b>Attacking Warp</b></span><br>
			Your magic provides you with a random warp effect when the next spell you cast will be an attack spell. This talent works best for chaos mages with a high Dexterity.<br>
			When your random spell choice indicates an attack spell, roll a d6 to determine the effect you’ll gain from the elemental warp. Even though you can’t cast the spell until your next turn, the warp effect applies now.<br>
